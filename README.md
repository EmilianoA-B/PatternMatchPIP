# PatternMatchPIP

A Python application for recognizing patterns in time-series data using the **Perceptually Important Points (PIP)** algorithm. This project allows users to load a `.csv` file, extract significant data points (peaks and valleys), and visualize the result through a simple GUI.

This project does the next:
- Reads decimal data from a CSV file (time, data)
- Applies the PIP algorithm to identify a defined number of key points (defined by stored patterns)
- Uses tkinter for it's GUI, lets you select a specific CSV.

How it was built?
- Python, csv, tkinter and matplotlib
